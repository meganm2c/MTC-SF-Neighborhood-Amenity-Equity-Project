# MTC-SF-Neighborhood-Amenity-Equity-Project (Group 15)

 By: Megan Hu and Neha Suresh

### Defining Amenities:
For this project, we define amenities as desirable features and services that enhance the quality of life, comfort, and convenience for residents in neighborhoods. To manage this broad definition, we categorize amenities as follows:
1) Public services: Schools, libraries, public transportation, and healthcare facilities like hospitals and clinics
2) Recreational: Parks, playgrounds, community centers, swimming pools, gyms, and walking or biking trails
3) Commercial: Shops (grocery), restaurants, coffee shops, and other local businesses
4) Natural features: natural areas like lakes, rivers, mountains, or open green spaces
5) Infrastructure: Basic needs like roads, electricity, and water supply 
This is not an exhaustive list, as there are more amenities like museums and tourist attractions. We’ll focus on categories 1-3, given the time constraints for this project and the lack of prior research for these categories.

### Motivating Problem: Why is equitable access to amenities important in neighborhoods?
Analyzing the equitable distribution of neighborhood amenities is important because it directly impacts two core groups of stakeholders: residents and the community at large. For residents, equitable access leads to immediate improvements in their health and well-being through features like walkability and access to essential services (grocery, healthcare, etc.), and also results in a higher overall quality of life, ensuring convenience and satisfaction. The positive impact extends broadly to the community, boosting social cohesion by offering shared spaces where people can gather, build trust, and form relationships. Ultimately, this research promotes the potential for reduced isolation and discrimination, while stimulating economic opportunity by helping create more vibrant, inclusive neighborhoods that support both development and job creation. 

### Updated Research Question and Hypothesis:
How do the size and distribution of neighborhood amenities in San Francisco relate to the socioeconomic and racial demographics of neighborhoods at the census-tract level for the most recent available data (most are 2023 or updated as needed), and what are the quantifiable disparities in access?
